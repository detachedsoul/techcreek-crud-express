# Techcreek Group 3 Express Assignment

This is a solution to an assignment to create `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete` operations using Express. Below are the endpoints and values to be used:

## Database connection

To test the endpoints, you need a database connection. The login details are:

- `MongoDB url`: mongodb+srv://detachedsoul:YouDontLoveMe@cluster0.3e4ku.mongodb.net/blogDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority

- `Port`: 8080

I know you would be thinking: "Omo, make I just hack this thing." You won't find my atm pin there so don't bother. üòè
